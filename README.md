Developed an Enhanced Super-Resolution GAN (ESRGAN) using pretrained weights to understand the architecture and improve image resolution.
The model enhances low-quality images by restoring fine details and textures.
It is applicable to real-world scenarios such as enhancing satellite images of urban areas.

Enhanced output images were also uploaded to clearly demonstrate the improvement in image quality and clarity.

How to Use (Inference)

Open the inference.py file.

Update the path to the pretrained model weights.

Set the path to the test image(s) you want to enhance.

Specify the output directory where the enhanced images will be saved.

Run the script to generate and store the super-resolved images.
